# ðŸŽ„Advent of Code 2022 ðŸŽ„
## Repo containing my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code event

I have loved this event every year I've known of it. It's helped me learn more about structuring algorithms, problem solving, and the deep lore behind Christmas and the North Pole that somehow missed in all the carols.

Solutions written in Pure Python 3.10 (where possible), and also making use of Numpy where it makes sense.
