## Repo containing my solutions to the 2022 Advent of Code event

I have loved this event every year I've known of it. It's helped me learn more about structuring algorithms, problem solving, and the deep lore behind Christmas and the North Pole.

Solutions written in pure Python 3.10 (where possible), and also making use of Numpy where it makes sense.

I've tried to write my solutions with high quality code, and make them readable and maintainable, so hopefully the solutions are easy to understand!
